I tried so many different things to get this API to work and after so much effort, it still does not work but I tried my best 

I can create POST requests to the server from Postman and they actually load in the tasks.json file in VsCode, but where I'm having an issue is connecting the requests to the front end to respond to onclick functions from the front end
